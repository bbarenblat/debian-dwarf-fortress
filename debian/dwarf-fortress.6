.SH NAME
dwarf-fortress \- control a band of dwarves as they establish an outpost
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwarf-fortress [\| -gen
.I id-number seed world-gen-param-title
\|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress
is an absurdly detailed indie roguelike which takes place in a massive, procedurally generated, open world.
Take command of a band of dwarves, guiding them as they mine, farm, and defend a new home, or become an adventurer and seek your fortune.
.PP
World detail in
.I Dwarf Fortress
cannot be underestimated.
History, NPC behaviors, terrain, weather, mineral deposits, and much more are generated anew by Dwarf Fortress's engine before the game begins and rendered in excruciating detail using an extended ASCII character set drawn with OpenGL.
New features are added all the time.
.SH OPTIONS
.B dwarf-fortress
is an interactive program, and most players will run it without arguments.
However, advanced users can batch-generate worlds using the
.B -gen
option, specifying a world ID number, an engine seed (or
.I RANDOM
to use a random seed), and parameters to the generation engine.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B dwarf-fortress
looks for user saves and movies in the directory described by
.BR DWARF_FORTRESS_DATA_HOME .
This defaults to
.BR $XDG_DATA_HOME/dwarf-fortress .
As
.I Dwarf Fortress
is alpha software, you are strongly encouraged to back up this directory.
