Description: control a band of dwarves as they establish a new outpost
 Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress is an absurdly
 detailed indie roguelike in which players control a dwarven outpost or an
 adventurer in a randomly generated, persistent world.
 .
 Although Dwarf Fortress is still in a work in progress, many features have
 already been implemented.
 .
   • The world is randomly generated with distinct civilizations spanning
     centuries of detailed history, hundreds of towns, caves and regions with
     various wildlife.
 .
   • The world persists as long as you like, over many games, recording
     historical events and tracking changes.
 .
   • Command your dwarves as they search for wealth in the mountain.
       ◦ Craft treasures and furniture from many materials and improve these
         objects with precious metals, jewels and more.
       ◦ Defend yourself against attacks from hostile civilizations, the
         wilderness, the depths, the dead and creatures of the night.
       ◦ Trade for all manner of exotic goods with your neighbors.
       ◦ Establish a barony and support the nobility as they make demands of
         your populace.
       ◦ Keep your dwarves happy and read their thoughts as they work and relax.
       ◦ Z coordinate allows you to dig out fortresses with multiple levels.
         Build towers or conquer the underworld.
       ◦ Build floodgates to divert water for farming or to drown your
         adversaries … and don’t forget the magma!
       ◦ Surgery, sutures, splints, crutches and more: care for your wounded
         dwarves instead of leaving them to fend for themselves.
       ◦ Retire your fortress, then unretire it after spending time playing
         other roles in the world.
       ◦ Honey, wax, pottery, windmills, waterwheels, soap, plaster, wool, eggs,
         dyes, cheese, glass, animal training, and much, much more …
 .
   • Play an adventurer and explore, quest for glory or seek vengeance.
       ◦ Meet adversaries from previous games.
       ◦ Recruit people to come with you on your journey.
       ◦ Explore without cumbersome plot restrictions – thriving capitals,
         villages, catacombs, labyrinths, bandit camps, caves and more!
       ◦ Seamlessly wander the world or travel more rapidly on the region map
         and in underground tunnels.
       ◦ Travel by day and search for a place to shelter as night falls.
       ◦ Listen to rumors and help out town and civilization leaders.
       ◦ Earn a reputation as a hero, friend, soldier, enemy, thug, etc. with
         the various civilizations in the world.
       ◦ Retire and meet your old characters.  Bring them along on an adventure
         with a new character or reactivate them and play directly.
       ◦ Z coordinate allows you to move between twisting underground caverns
         and scale structures, fighting adversaries above and below.  Climb, jump
         and sprint!
       ◦ Stealth system with vision arcs which also respects vegetation density
         and other factors.
       ◦ Use signs like shoe impressions and animal tracks to hunt and avoid
         danger.
       ◦ Steal a mummy’s treasure or learn the secrets of life and death at a
         necromancer’s tower.
       ◦ Visit your retired fortresses and ask your dwarves to join you on
         adventures.
 .
   • The combat model uses skills, body parts, individual tissues, material
     properties, aimed attacks, wrestling, one-time opportunities, charging and
     dodging between squares, bleeding, pain, nausea, various poison effects and
     much more.  Attacks and other movements extend over several instants,
     allowing you to deliberately catch enemy blows or plan your counter-attack.
 .
   • Hundreds of animals and other monsters, including many that are randomly
     generated for each world.
 .
   • Multi-tile climbable trees and many, many kinds of plants.  Fruit, flowers
     and falling leaves.
 .
   • A dynamic weather model tracks wind, humidity and air masses to create
     fronts, clouds, rain storms and blizzards.
 .
   • Over two hundred rock and mineral types are incorporated into the world,
     placed in their proper geological environments.
 .
   • Extended ASCII character set rendered in 16 colors (including black) as
     well as 8 background colors (including black).
