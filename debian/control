Description: control a band of dwarves as they establish a new outpost
 Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress is an absurdly
 detailed indie roguelike which takes place in a massive, procedurally
 generated, open world.  Take command of a band of dwarves, guiding them as they
 mine, farm, and defend a new home, or become an adventurer and seek your
 fortune.
 .
 World detail cannot be underestimated.  History, NPC behaviors, terrain,
 weather, mineral deposits, and much more are generated anew by Dwarf Fortressâ€™s
 engine before the game begins and rendered in excruciating detail using an
 extended ASCII character set drawn with OpenGL.  New features are added all the
 time.
